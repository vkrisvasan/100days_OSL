# 100days_OSL
Open Source AI Libraries Daily Series!

Day1: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/1_OSL_aisuite.ipynb diving into @AndrewYNg game-changing AI Suite library. Learn how to unlock its full potential with our detailed tutorial notebook.

Day2: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/2_OSL_pydantic_ai.ipynb Pydantic AI an extension of Pydantic that allows for the creation of models that can interact with AI systems. It provides a way to define data structures with validation and serialization capabilities while integrating with AI. PydanticAI is a Python Agent Framework designed to make it less painful to build production grade applications with Generative AI.

Day 3:  https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/3_OSL_crewAI.ipynb CrewAI is a powerful framework for orchestrating role-playing AI agents. It enables you to create autonomous AI agents that can collaborate together to accomplish complex tasks.

Day 4: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/4_OSL_Swarm_Agent.ipynb Swarm focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.  Also read https://sbagency.medium.com/openai-swarm-on-llama3-multi-agent-framework-aa8750cfdd94 

Day 5: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/5_OSL_pandas_AI.ipynb PandasAI is a Python platform that makes it easy to ask questions to your data in natural language.  It helps non-technical users to interact with their data in a more natural way, and it helps technical users to save time, and effort when working with data.

Day 6: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/6_OSL_Phidata.ipynb  Phidata is a framework for building multi-modal agents, use phidata to: Build multi-modal agents with memory, knowledge, tools and reasoning. Build teams of agents that can work together to solve problems. Chat with your agents using a beautiful Agent UI. Monitor, evaluate and optimize your agents. Build agentic systems i.e. applications with an API, database and vectordb.

Day 7: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/7_OSL__ScrapegraphAI.ipynb Get the data you need from any website. Easily extract and gather information with just a few lines of code with a simple api. Turn websites into clean and usable structured data. https://scrapegraphai.com/

Day 8: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/8_OSL__Crawl4AI.ipynb  Crawl4AI has one clear task: to make crawling and data extraction from web pages easy and efficient, especially for large language models (LLMs) and AI applications. Whether you are using it as a REST API or a Python library, Crawl4AI offers a robust and flexible solution with full asynchronous support. 

Day 9: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/9_OSL_Autogen.ipynb AutoGen is an open-source framework that leverages multiple agents to enable complex workflows. 

Day 10: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/10_OSL__Composio.ipynb. composio Integration Platform for AI Agents & LLMs. Developer First Agentic Integration Platform. Fastest way to Authenticate & Integrate LLM to tools via Function Calling

Day 11: https://github.com/vkrisvasan/100days_OSL/blob/main/11_OSL__DSPy.ipynb DSPy is the framework for programming—rather than prompting—language models. It allows you to iterate fast on building modular AI systems and offers algorithms for optimizing their prompts and weights, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.
